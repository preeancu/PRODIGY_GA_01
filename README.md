## 🎯 Objective: Fine-tune OpenAI’s GPT-2 model to generate coherent & contextually relevant text using a custom dataset.

**🛠️ Tools Used:**
- Hugging Face Transformers (powered by PyTorch)
- Google Colab
- Google Drive (for dataset storage)
- Custom text dataset

**💡 Key Highlights:**
- Loaded and tokenized real-world custom text data
- Fine-tuned the GPT-2 model using Hugging Face's Trainer API
- Implemented a text generation pipeline that creates meaningful completions for prompts
- Understood the internals of language modeling, tokenization, and transfer learning for NLP
